# Phase 3 - Steps 4 & 5: Issue Submission & Tracking

## ✅ Preparation Complete

- [x] Repository created: https://github.com/pfaria32/open_claw_token_economy
- [x] Files pushed (39 files, master branch)
- [x] Links updated (master branch instead of main)
- [x] Issue text prepared

---

## 📝 Step 4: Submit GitHub Issue (5-10 minutes)

### Instructions

1. **Open the issue form:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/new
   - (You may need to be signed in to GitHub)

2. **Fill in the issue:**
   - **Title:** `Feature: Add plugin hooks for token cost management`
   - **Body:** Copy the entire contents from `ISSUE_SUBMISSION.md` (starting from "### Problem")

3. **Add labels (if you have permission):**
   - `enhancement`
   - `feature-request`
   - `plugins`
   - `cost-optimization`
   
   *(Note: You may not be able to add labels if you're not a maintainer - that's fine, they'll add them)*

4. **Submit the issue**

5. **Copy the issue URL** (it will be something like `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/123`)

## 📊 Step 5: Track Progress

### After you submit, tell me the issue URL and I'll:

1. Create `ISSUE_TRACKING.md` with the URL
2. Set up a monitoring checklist
3. Help draft responses when maintainers comment
4. Update project status

### What to Expect

**Timeline:**
- **Days 1-3:** Initial maintainer response (check GitHub notifications daily)
- **Week 1-2:** Discussion and design iteration
- **Week 2-4:** Implementation decision
- **Month 2:** Testing and merge (if approved)

**Response patterns:**
- **Best case (70%):** "Great proposal! Let's discuss..." → Constructive engagement
- **Good case (20%):** "Interesting but let's adjust..." → Design iteration
- **Slow case (10%):** No response for 2+ weeks → Polite follow-up needed

### Notification Setup

**Recommended:**
1. Go to https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
2. Click "Watch" → "All Activity"
3. Check email/GitHub notifications daily (first week)

## 🎯 After Submission - Next Actions

Once you've submitted and have the issue URL:

**Tell me:**
```
"Issue submitted: [paste URL]"
```

**Then I'll:**
1. ✅ Create tracking document
2. ✅ Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
3. ✅ Set up response templates
4. ✅ Monitor for maintainer comments (if you want)
5. ✅ Help draft replies as needed

## 💡 Communication Tips

**When maintainers respond:**

✅ **Do:**
- Respond within 24 hours (shows engagement)
- Be flexible and collaborative
- Offer to help implement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Show willingness to iterate

❌ **Don't:**
- Push too hard if they're lukewarm
- Be defensive about design decisions
- Assume they'll implement it
- Ghost the conversation
- Overwhelm with too much detail upfront

**I can help draft responses** - just paste their comment and say "draft a response"

## 🛟 If You Need Help

**Can't submit issue yourself?**
- Option 1: Attach Chrome tab with Browser Relay extension → I'll do it
- Option 2: Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) → I'll use that
- Option 3: Copy-paste from ISSUE_SUBMISSION.md yourself (fastest)

**Not sure what to say?**
- I'll help draft responses to maintainer comments
- Just forward their questions to me

**Want to check status?**
- Say "check OpenClaw issue status"
- I'll pull the latest comments and summarize
