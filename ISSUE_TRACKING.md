## Response Templates

When maintainers respond, use these as starting points:

**If they're interested:**
```
Thanks for the positive feedback! I'm happy to [discuss further / implement / adjust the design].

Let me know if you'd like me to:
- Create a PR with the implementation
- Iterate on the design based on your concerns
- Provide additional examples or documentation

Looking forward to collaborating on this!
```

**If they have concerns:**
```
Thanks for the feedback! I appreciate your concerns about [specific issue].

Here's how we could address that:
[provide solution]

Would [alternative approach] work better for OpenClaw's architecture?
```

**If they suggest changes:**
```
That makes sense! I can definitely adjust [aspect] to [their suggestion].

Let me update the design and get back to you with:
- [specific change 1]
- [specific change 2]

Should I create an updated design document first, or would you prefer a draft PR?
```
