## Current Status

**Waiting for:** OpenClaw maintainer response (estimated 1-7 days for initial feedback)

**Expected timeline:**
- Days 1-3: Initial maintainer response
- Week 1-2: Design discussion and iteration
- Week 2-4: Implementation decision
- Month 2: Testing and merge (if approved)

---

## What Happens Next

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Monitor GitHub issue daily for maintainer comments
2. Respond within 24 hours if they engage
3. Be flexible and collaborative in discussions

### Medium-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
- Iterate on design based on feedback
- Help implement if requested
- OR implement ourselves if they approve

### Long-term (Month 2+)
- Integration testing after hooks merge
- Deploy plugins to production
- Measure actual token savings
- Document real-world results

## Risk Assessment

**Best case (70% probability):** Constructive engagement, implementation within 3-4 weeks  
**Good case (20% probability):** Design iteration needed, implementation within 4-8 weeks  
**Slow case (10% probability):** No response, pivot to DIY fork after 2 weeks

---

## Next Actions for Pedro

**Daily (first week):**
- Check GitHub notifications for issue #14779
- Alert Bob if maintainers respond

**When maintainers respond:**
- Forward their comments to Bob
- Bob will draft response
- Approve and post response

**If no response after 2 weeks:**
- Decide: wait longer or pivot to DIY fork
